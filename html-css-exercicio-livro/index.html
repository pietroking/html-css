          <h2></h2><p style="font-size: medium;">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and 
          web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript it forms a triad of 
          cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.</br>
          <span class="tab"></span>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other 
          objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a 
          means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other itens. HTML elements are delineated by 
          tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <mark style="background-color: black; color: aliceblue;">&lt;img /&gt;</mark> and <mark style="background-color: black; color: aliceblue;">&lt;input /&gt;</mark> introduce content 
          into the page directly. Others such as <mark style="background-color: black; color: aliceblue;">&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</mark> surround and provide information about 
          document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML 
          tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</br>
          <span class="tab"></span>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as Javascript which affect the 
          behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
          The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintener of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has 
          encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</br>
          <span class="tab"></span>In 1980, physicist <ins>Tim Berners-Lee</ins>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, 
          a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo 
          proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the 
          browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems 
          engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was 
          not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many 
          areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</br>
          <span class="tab"></span>After the HTML and HTML+ draft expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working 
          Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be 
          treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</br>
